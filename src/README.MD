All the source code is included in one file, sorry about that. It probably contains errors.

The source code for this (P3DC V6.1) is very sloppy. It was my first project other than a hello world application in C++. It is not optimized, and the coding does not meet any standards. Many parts of it simply do not make sense, and there are much better ways to do what was done. The code resembles C more than C++ due to the lack of use of classes. It was created for my own personal use, and was a learning experience. I decided to make it open source because I am unable to keep it up to date, and don't have time to fix the errors that it contains.


The license is simple:
P3DC is free to use. If re-releasing source
code, you must include all authors names. No
need in a binary form (although it is appreciated)


Have fun, and enjoy
